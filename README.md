# Project Instructions

## Mission (problem to solve)

**Create and Document an Organization**
Design an organization and document it (using simple html) so that your Investors (Angel Investors - for profit startup, Bosses - an established business unit, Donors - non-profit) can approve the projects and fund them.

## Technologies / Topics to Learn

These basic work flow and information sharing skills are critical for all your projects in this class (and in general it is important to know how to share work and to keep old versions)

* **HTML** basics - (headers, lists, links, images, text and paragraphs)
* **Git** workflow - branches (master and development branches), the ability to roll back as needed, and shared work (submitting & reviewing -- pull requests)
* **Kanban** workflow - how to track your own progress and keep going
* **Incremental** Workflow - how to use many little steps that are learnable and easy to change to accomplish a larger goal
